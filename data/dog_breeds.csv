These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth’s great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes. The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America’s most popular dog breeds.

Cotons are known for a profuse white coat that is as soft as cotton (or, as the French say, “coton”). Their primary job is to provide amusement, comfort, and companionship.The bond between Cotons and their people is so tight that owners discuss it in human terms. Coton fanciers describe them as “witty” companions “at times boisterous but never demanding” and “naturally clownish and lighthearted,” who possess a “remarkably gentle, sympathetic awareness.” Amusing traits of these long-lived jesters include unique vocalizations and a knack for walking on their hind legs. The Coton de Tulear, “Royal Dog of Madagascar,” is a bright, happy-go-lucky companion dog whose favorite activities include clowning, cavorting, and following their special human around the house.
